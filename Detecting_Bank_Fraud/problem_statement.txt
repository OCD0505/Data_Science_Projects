Background:
In the financial sector, detecting fraudulent transactions is critical to preventing financial losses and protecting customers. The dataset provided contains transaction records from a financial institution, including information about the transactions, originating and destination accounts, and whether each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or not.

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on the provided features. The model should be capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall, minimizing the number of false positives and false negatives.

Data Description:
step: The step in the transaction sequence.
type: Type of transaction (e.g., payment, transfer).
amount: Transaction amount.
nameOrig: Identifier for the originating account.
oldbalanceOrg: Balance of the originating account before the transaction.
newbalanceOrig: Balance of the originating account after the transaction.
nameDest: Identifier for the destination account.
oldbalanceDest: Balance of the destination account before the transaction.
newbalanceDest: Balance of the destination account after the transaction.
isFraud: Indicator whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
Tasks:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the target variable (isFraud).
Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
Engineer features to enhance model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of transaction amounts, types, and balances.
Examine the relationship between the features and the target variable.
Identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate fraudulent behavior.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to predict the likelihood of fraud.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC).
Model Tuning and Optimization:

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE).
Model Evaluation and Validation:

Assess the model's generalizability on the test set.
Conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Deployment and Monitoring:

Develop a strategy for integrating the model into a production environment.
Implement monitoring mechanisms to track model performance and update as necessary.
Deliverables:
A detailed report documenting the data exploration, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results.
Code repository with well-documented scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
A presentation summarizing the findings and providing actionable insights for preventing fraudulent transactions.
